## Stock Reservations

This example shows you how to create stock reservations using the PRIMAVERA API and some components, such as the PriGrelha and PriMemorizaLayout. This can be done into two ways:
1. Reservations on the Source: reserve expected stock for one or more customer orders when you create supplier orders.
2. Reservations on the Destination: reserve available or expected stock (supplier orders created in the system) when you create customer orders.
